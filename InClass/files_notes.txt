text files are files that contain human readable chraracters
like alphabets, digits, symbols, etc.
  -images, audio, etc. are usually stored ina  different file called binary files.

reading and writing to files
  -first a connection must be established between Python shell and disk (where the file resides).
    -this is done by creating a file object, using the function open.
    -open copies to file into buffer memory (making it faster to work upon)
      -accessing data from the buffer memory is much faster than accessing it from the hard disk

  -files can be iterated line-by-line using for statement
    -you can perform your desired operations within.

  -finally, always close the connection at the end

input_file = open("newFile.txt", 'r')
for line in input_file:

input__file.close()
